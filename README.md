# JPM_ERM_Analysis
Report, Excel and Python script of a personal project I've been working on. I wanted to conduct ERM (Enterprise Risk Managment) analysis and Monte Carlo simulation using JPMorgan Chase's 10-K reports (2021-2025). Main goal of this project is to forecast key financial metrics under different risk scenarios.
